# Go Terminal Application

## Overview

This Go Terminal Application is a simple command-line interface (CLI) tool that launches a Bash shell (or another shell on Windows) in a pseudo-terminal (PTY) environment. It allows users to interact with the shell, see their inputs in real-time, and view output generated by the commands they run. The application is built using Go's `os/exec` and `bufio` packages, along with the `github.com/creack/pty` library for handling pseudo-terminal interactions.

## Features

- **Real-time input display**: Users can see their inputs as they type.
- **Command execution**: Run any commands available in the shell environment.
- **Output management**: The application captures and displays output from the executed commands.
- **Cross-platform support**: Compatible with Unix-based systems and Windows.

## Requirements

To run this application, you'll need:

- Go 1.16 or higher installed on your machine.
- Bash shell (or CMD/PowerShell on Windows).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (replace `https://github.com/Kaiftech/simple-terminal-in-go.git)` with your actual repository URL):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kaiftech/simple-terminal-in-go.git
   cd terminal
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   This application uses the `creack/pty` library. Install it by running:
   ```bash
   go get github.com/creack/pty
   ```

3. **Build the application**:
   Run the following command to build the executable:
   ```bash
   go build -o terminal
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

After building the application, you can run it using:

```bash
./main.go
```

### Input and Output

- Once the application is running, you can start typing commands directly.
- The input will be echoed back to the console as you type.
- Press **Enter** to execute the command.
- The output of the command will be displayed on the console.

### Example Commands

Here are some example commands you can run in the terminal:

- `ls` - List directory contents.
- `pwd` - Print the current working directory.
- `echo "Hello, World!"` - Print a message to the terminal.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: Ensure you have permission to execute the shell.
2. **Command Not Found**: Make sure the command you're trying to run exists in your shell environment.

### Tips

- If you're running the application on Windows, you may want to replace the `bash` command in the code with `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` for compatibility.
